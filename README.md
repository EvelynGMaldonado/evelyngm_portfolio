<h2 id="description"> Project Description </h2>
A professional portfolio is an excellent way to present your work to potential employers and display the skills that qualify you for a position; it can contain proof of your skills, samples, visual demonstrations of your craft and letters of recommendation along with your resume. This React Professional Portfolio has been built from scratch and I have added skills and projects along the way during my certification.

## Installation 
Requiered dependencies: react,bootstrap, react-pdf, scripts, router-dom, dom.

## Usage 
An online portfolio allows you to share your work with a wider audience and can be accessed when your audience has time dedicated to review your breadth of work. It is important to have a portfolio with deployed web applications so the companies and future employers will see and have a better idea of your work and skills.
